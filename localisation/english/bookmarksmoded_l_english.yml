 DOZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Donbas has risen. Three years have passed since the Donbas Republic was dismantled and replaced by Humble's Socialist Region. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Donbas Region by the Uzivka Treaty are long forgotten, and the Donbas Army grows stronger by the day. Another War for the Resouces is on the horizon."
