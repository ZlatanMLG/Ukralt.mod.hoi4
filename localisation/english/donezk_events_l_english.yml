 pavlograd_regulate_borders.1.t:0 "Border regulation Treaty with the Soviets"
 pavlograd_regulate_borders.1.d:0 "The border between us and the Soviet Union was based on the agreement between the countries of the former Entente. At the time of the signing of the treaty, British troops controlled the city of Taganrog, the settlement of Shakhta, Bila Kalitka, and surrounded Rostov on the right bank of the Don River. The geographical definition of Donbas included the absolute majority of the territories controlled at that time, but it was decided to cede them for the sake of an earlier ceasefire. Today our officials presented us a plan of integrating new territories, currently under control of Reds. The plan is simple - we get the control of wished state, but in exchange offer resouce exploration program and rights to them as well. We have two propositions - moderate one, that includes only Rostov region, and expanded, with Mikhailovka included. Of course, the chances of Soviet`s accepting the offer is lesser in the last one."

 doz_political.1.t:0 "Our Future"
 doz_political.1.d:0 "Vynnychenko obviously sympathizes with the ideas of socialism and has some support from the Russian curators, but only to a certain extent and probably only temporarily. Public support for his course of uncertainty and compromise views gradually declines, and the ideas of independence and anti-colonial propaganda are popularized not jokingly. Control from the metropolises is becoming increasingly weak, and financial support and investment may soon falter. Donbas is faced with an important decision as to which way it will move in the future. The most popular option appears to be building one's own statehood, but this is also the most difficult choice to implement, which can lead to Western intervention or exploitation of the idea of a people's republic by the Soviet Union for its own, unpredictable purposes. Also, Vynnychenko does not suit the democratic metropolis, so with decisive intervention and support, he will be replaced by a more loyal candidate, which in turn can result in direct dependence and colonialism, as well as in the construction of a democratic workers' society. Volodymyr Vynnychenko, on the other hand, may, under the pressure of the people and the eastern neighbor, completely concentrate on the ideas of socialism, or even be "replaced" by a more radical and decisive candidate. No matter what happens next, big changes await Donbas."
 doz_political.1.a:0 "We are more than just puppets!"
 doz_political.1.b:0 "We won't survive without support!"

 doz_political.2.t:0 "The Sinner and Devil"
 doz_political.2.d:0 "It is obvious that the compromise cannot continue any longer. The Soviets are becoming increasingly desperate in trying to absorb Donbas into their own sphere of influence, and maybe not just a sphere. They tell stories about the construction of real socialism, about real politics that will be carried out by the people themselves, they tell about fairy tales of communist equality and utopia, and about the need to create people's power. But all this can end with unforeseen consequences and a heavy economic burden for society, which has existed for years at the expense of mostly Western investments. The democracies, whose influence is weak from year to year, still do not want to give up the gains and revenues from our territories and with due efforts will be able to lead us to an innovative democratic society, scientific development, and prosperity! Or they will finally complete the process of transforming the territories of Donbas into their own common colony. A beauty like Donbas will no longer be able to dance between two partners. It is necessary to make a choice and take risks."
 doz_political.2.a:0 "Western Democracies are our only hope!"
 doz_political.2.b:0 "Get up Donbas! Get up my native land!"

 doz_political.3.t:0 "Our Past"
 doz_political.3.d:0 "After the events of the late 1910s and early twenties, our statehood rests exclusively on contractual relations with the countries of the former Entente. Foreign tycoons from the countries of Old Europe and the Commonwealth of Nations were persuaded to intervene in the conflict that was passing through our territory in order to secure their own factories and industries. Of course, the Reds, who won the Russian Civil War, did not like it, but they no longer had the strength to continue fighting. Similarly, there was no desire to fight the communists in the democracies at that time. Spheres of influence and resources were decided to be divided, with the majority of the Western powers, which, as a matter of fact, confidently controlled the territories at that time. But over time, the attention of Western countries shifted to their own problems and turbulent Germany. With this in mind, the Soviets did not stop trying to change public opinion and turn our population against the tycoons, spreading narratives of serfdom and slavery to Western masters. Because of this, a large part of the people supports the communists' fairy tales about equality and brotherhood."
 doz_political.3.a:0 "Restlessly..."

 doz_political.5.t:0 "Question of concessions to the Soviets"
 doz_political.5.d:0 "One of the conditions for stopping the war was the transfer of some concessions to the Soviet government, as well as ensuring the functionality of the Soviet Workers' Party in Donbas. Instead, Soviet specialists were engaged in the development of railway infrastructure. However, the monopoly of the Reds has become a burden for the development of the region's economy, so it would be appropriate to consider options for solving the problem. On the one hand, we can ensure the development of Soviet influence on the political sphere of people's life, and assure their leadership of full support for the course of socialism and communism. Another option is an ultimatum to the Soviet commissars and the complete nationalization of all railway companies. Of course, the Union will not like this. There is also a compromise option, with the relaxation of current concessions."
 doz_political.5.a:0 "Increase Soviet delegation"
 doz_political.5.b:0 "No Compromises and Reds' fairy tales!"
 doz_political.5.c:0 "Propose a counteroffer."
